      I have always loved quotes. And, I honestly think everyone does as they have a means of so concisely and
      eloquently conveying exactly what we're thinking. Although this blog is not exactly a typical blog, here
      are some of my favorite quotes, and I hope you'll share some of yours with me!<br><br><br>
      
      "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it." -Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird<br><br>

      "Be somebody who makes everybody feel like a somebody."<br><br>

      "Surround yourself with people who see your value and remind you of it." <br><br>

      "Confidence is not 'they will like me.' Confidence is 'I'll be fine if they don't.'"<br><br>

      "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you'll land among the stars."<br><br>

      "You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending."<br><br>

      "You were born to be real, not to be perfect."<br><br>

      "What holds you back is not what you are, it's what you think you aren't."<br><br>

      "The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain."<br><br><br>
