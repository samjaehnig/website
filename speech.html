      A bit over a year ago I graduated from high school. My graduating class was around 600 students, and so it made
      sense that only a select few would give graduation speeches. Knowing this, my AP Literature teacher assigned us
      a final that would allow all of us to at least give a graduation speech of sorts to some of our class. The topic was "This I Believe."
      Here's a <a id="blog_inner_link" href="docs/this_i_believe.pdf">link</a> to what I wrote and spoke about back then. I was reflecting a bit on this speech, what I
      knew and thought I knew then, and what I have learned and continue to believe now. So, this isn't a revision
      of what I used to believe, but a reflection of what I know about myself now. <br><br>
      
      <div id="inner_quote">
          <i>"Everyone teaches you something in your life. Be it 'how to speak, how to eat, whom to trust, how to live, how to care...' Ethically,
          every individual you meet is a teacher in one way or the other. They teach you <b>'life'</b>." </i>

      I have always really loved learning. In elementary and middle school, I would cry on the last day of school which instead of signifying the
      freedom of summer, meant to me not being in a classroom for the next few months. Maybe I would enjoy summer and not being swamped with assignments
      for a week or two, but there would always come this emptiness: a longingness to be back in the classroom, a longingness to just keep learning new
      things and a desire to keep expanding and challenging myself mentally. <br><br>
      
      Even beyond raw academics, there are so many ways to expand our minds, both in and out of the classroom. I think one of the most powerful things
      I have come to realize is the value we each carry with us everyday from simply experiencing life. Regardless of our similarities, we as humans possess such
      widely different life experiences. There is so much we can learn from others, and also so much we are able to give to those around us simply by sharing
      our own journeys, insights and knowledge. I think for this reason I have also always loved just listening to others talk. There is an intimacy that
      sometimes only comes from the unique perspective of a peer, a mentor, or another human being, and there are some lessons which simply can never be
      effectively taught by or learned from a textbook. <br><br>
      
      Throughout high school and into college I was and I am constantly looking to be a part of such communities which are so driven by and dependent on
      this infrastructure of collaboration, and communal knowledge. Whether it's tutoring, coaching or mentoring I hope to always be finding a way to simultaneously
      learn from and teach others.<br><br>
      
      I've realized more recently that this is one of my favorite things about being a student at Michigan. It has a way of attracting this community which is so
      driven to improve, and learn, but also to suceed together. Everyone I meet shares this special excitement about them to share what they know and what they've
      learned, and to help others. And, I think thats actually pretty rare. At least where I grew up, it always felt like there was this
      academic hierarchy; how smart you were determined how "good" of a person you were, and intelligence was a sort of indication of how much respect others
      had for you. It is so valuable to now be a part of a community which inspires itself in a way. Seeing the passion everyone around me brings to what they
      do is very motivating and powerful within itself. This ability we all have to simultaneously inspire and be inspired by those around us is sometimes
      what keeps me going. <br><br>
      
      There's so much power in being able to use my experiences, and what I've learned for something beyond myself. The capacity we have to impact the lives around us,
      and even the world in a positive way by being ourselves and sharing our stories is immensely movtivating. So, do you, always. But also, live, explain, share, talk,
      give whenever you can. Believe in the importance of your voice and your story, and believe in the ability you have to give to others through it.
      Remember that we all can always learn from one another, and appreciate that. We teach each other "<b>Life</b>."
