      Welcome to my first blog and my first website!!! <br>
      This is the first of a sporadic series of blogs about my journey in computer/data science. <br><br>

      I'd say it all began my sophomore year of high school. I took my first intro java class and found myself
      thoroughly enjoying the logic aspect of coding. I've always been partial to STEM subjects, but nothing
      had ever resonated so well with the way my brain is wired to think. That said, at the time I found
      computer science a subject I merely enjoyed, not something I was sure would stay a part of my life.<br><br>

      Taking AP Computer Science my senior year allowed me to really understand my love for the subject.
      I would spend hours perfecting projects well after they were turned in, as building, debugging, problem
      solving, and the process as a whole became so enticing. By the end of the year I was set on studying
      Computer Science in college.<br><br>
        
      In my freshman year I took two of UofM's core computer sceince classes, where I learned a ton about data
      structures, various algorithms, complexity analysis and improvement, etc. As much as I loved these
      classes, I still didn't have an understanding of how the concepts I was learning in class would apply to
      work I might do in the future, or what these "personal projects" people were always talking about even were.
      Although I enjoyed learning computer science in school, I had no understanding of the more practical side.
      To be honest, I felt a little lost. <br><br>

      About two weeks ago I joined enlight cohort 0, a super cool, collaborative and
      interactive educational coding program run by some of my amazing and talented friends from Michigan.
      The program has really begun to open my eyes to the endless possibilities computer and data science
      have to offer. I've had the chance to learn so much in such a short time. It has ignited in me a new
      passion for learning and developing, and I can't wait to keep exploring and creating.<br><br>

      So, that's where I am now. My first "personal project," a website, finally up.
      More updates coming soon and I hope you've enjoyed this first blog :). <br>
